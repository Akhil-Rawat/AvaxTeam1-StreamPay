# StreamPay Subgraph Adaptation for Avalanche

## Overview
This subgraph has been successfully adapted from Arbitrum to Avalanche C-Chain, maintaining all analytics functionality while integrating with the new Solidity-based StreamPay contract.

## Key Changes Made

### 1. Network Configuration
- **Network**: Changed from `arbitrum-sepolia` to `avalanche`
- **Contract Address**: Updated to deployed Fuji testnet address: `0x08006F413fbb555eFfcc9A27e9A01980B0e42207`
- **Start Block**: Set to deployment block for efficient indexing

### 2. ABI Updates
- **Source**: Updated from Rust Arbitrum contract to Solidity contract
- **File**: `abis/StreamPay.json` (generated from Foundry build artifacts)
- **Events**: All original events preserved with identical signatures

### 3. Mapping Files
- **Renamed**: `subscription-escrow.ts` → `stream-pay.ts`
- **Imports**: Updated to use `StreamPay` instead of `SubscriptionEscrow`
- **Event Handlers**: Enhanced with comprehensive analytics tracking

### 4. New Event Support
Added handlers for escrow events not present in original subgraph:
- `EscrowDeposit`: Tracks user deposits to escrow system
- `EscrowWithdrawal`: Tracks user withdrawals from escrow

### 5. Enhanced Analytics
- **Global Stats**: Comprehensive platform-wide metrics tracking
- **Provider Analytics**: Detailed provider performance metrics  
- **Plan Analytics**: Subscription and revenue tracking per plan
- **Real-time Updates**: All entities updated on relevant events

## Deployed Contract Events

The subgraph indexes the following events from the StreamPay contract:

### Core Events
- `ProviderRegistered(address provider, string name)`
- `PlanCreated(uint256 planId, address provider, uint256 price, uint256 interval)`
- `SubscriptionCreated(uint256 subscriptionId, address user, uint256 planId)`
- `PaymentProcessed(address from, address to, uint256 amount, uint256 subscriptionId)`
- `ProviderEarnings(address provider, uint256 planId, uint256 amount)`

### Escrow Events
- `EscrowDeposit(address user, uint256 amount, uint256 newBalance)`
- `EscrowWithdrawal(address user, uint256 amount, uint256 newBalance)`

## Analytics Features

### Provider Dashboard
- Total revenue and earnings tracking
- Active subscription counts
- Plan performance metrics
- Monthly/weekly revenue calculations

### Platform Analytics
- Global platform statistics
- Daily metrics for time-series analysis
- User activity tracking
- Revenue and transaction volume

### Subscription Analytics
- Subscription lifecycle tracking
- Payment history and patterns
- Churn rate calculations
- Average subscription values

## GraphQL Schema Entities

### Core Entities
- `Provider`: Service provider information and analytics
- `Plan`: Subscription plan details and performance
- `UserSubscription`: Individual subscription tracking
- `Payment`: Transaction records and analytics
- `ProviderEarning`: Earnings distribution tracking

### Analytics Entities
- `GlobalStats`: Platform-wide metrics
- `DailyMetric`: Time-series data for charts
- `EscrowDeposit`: Escrow deposit tracking
- `EscrowWithdrawal`: Escrow withdrawal tracking

## Deployment Status

✅ **Schema**: Validated and compatible with Avalanche contract
✅ **ABI**: Generated from deployed Solidity contract
✅ **Mappings**: Full TypeScript implementation with error handling
✅ **Build**: Successfully compiles without errors
✅ **Events**: All contract events mapped and handled

## Next Steps

1. **Deploy Subgraph**: Deploy to The Graph Network or hosted service
2. **Test Indexing**: Verify event indexing with test transactions
3. **Frontend Integration**: Connect frontend to GraphQL endpoint
4. **Analytics Dashboard**: Implement provider analytics dashboard

## Technical Notes

- **Network**: Avalanche C-Chain (compatible with Ethereum tooling)
- **Starting Block**: Set to contract deployment block for efficiency
- **Graph Protocol**: Uses standard Graph Protocol conventions
- **TypeScript**: Fully typed implementation with proper error handling
- **Schema Version**: Compatible with latest Graph Node requirements

The subgraph is now fully adapted for Avalanche and ready for deployment, providing the same comprehensive analytics capabilities as the original Arbitrum version.
